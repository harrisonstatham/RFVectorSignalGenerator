### Branching

If you are unfamiliar with Git, then branches allow you to keep "multiple" copies of the same work all without interfering with each other. When you push changes to GitHub make sure to push to your own, personal, branch first and then submit pull requests to the main branch when something needs to be updated accordingly.
